Installing Jobs
==================
The framework supports programatic jobs. Each class in the app/jobs folder is a descriete task.
To support jobs you need to add a cron job to execute
    scripts/cron.sh
The period at which you set up this cron job is the fastest that a job can be scheduled for within the frame work.
We recomend that you set this up to run hourly or daily depending on your application.
